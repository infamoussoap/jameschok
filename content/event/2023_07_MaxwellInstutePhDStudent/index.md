title: Rational Function Approximation as Constrained Optimization

summary: Rational Function Approximation.
abstract: 'Function approximation traditionally writes the target function as a linear combination of a set of basis functions {Pn(x)}. However, when written as a rational function with an n-degree polynomial divided by an m-degree polynomial, it gives an approximation as good as using n + m basis functions. Rational functions have the added benefit of providing better approximations to non-smooth functions. We propose a new method for rational function approximation. Using Bernstein Polynomials, we pose the problem as a constrained optimization problem, which is solved approximately using a computationally cheap iteration scheme. We also present preliminary approximation bounds.'
